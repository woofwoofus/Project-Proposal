Ghost for Mobile

Ghost is a word game in which players take turns adding letters to a growing word fragment, 
trying not to be the one to complete a valid word. Each fragment must be the beginning of an 
actual word, and usually some minimum is set on the length of a word that counts, such as 
three or four letters. The player who completes a word loses the round and earns a "letter", 
with players being eliminated when they have been given all five letters of the word "ghost".
